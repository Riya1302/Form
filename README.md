# Code Explanation

## HTML Structure

The HTML is structured into three main parts: the header (navbar), the tools section (tools), and the form area (form-area). Each part is styled with CSS to provide a clean layout.

## CSS Styling

The CSS provides styling for various elements:
body: Sets up the font and layout.
navbar: Styles the header with a title and save button.
tools: Styles the sidebar containing form element tools.
tool-item: Styles each tool item in the sidebar.
form-area: Styles the main area where the form elements are displayed.
form-wrapper: Styles the container holding the form elements.
form-group: Styles each form element group, including labels, inputs, selects, textareas, and buttons.


## JavaScript Functionality

Drag-and-Drop Initialization: The dragula library is used to enable drag-and-drop functionality for reordering form elements.
saveForm Function: Collects data from the form elements and logs it as JSON in the console. It gathers information such as id, type, label, placeholder, and options for each form element.
addField Function: Adds a new form element (input, select, or textarea) to the form container with editable labels and placeholders.
removeField Function: Removes a form element from the form container.
generateUniqueId Function: Generates a unique ID for each new form element using a random string generator.
